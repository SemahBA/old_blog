## Recon

**nmap**

From nmap scan we find 3 open ports

  ssh(22),http(80),HTTPS/Splunk (8089)

```

## Web application

Visiting the web page :

Looking around, there is an email "info@doctors.htb"

so i added ``doctors.htb`` to hosts file

![](https://i.imgur.com/xuvZhqW.png)

I launched gobuster, and started looking around but no SQLi seemed to work, so i created an account.

**Gobuster found:**

```
/home (Status: 302)
/login (Status: 200)
/archive (Status: 200)
/register (Status: 200)
/account (Status: 302)
/logout (Status: 302)
```

**New message** tab creates a new message and display it in the home page:

After creating the new message, we check code source of /archive, we find :

Whatever I typed in the **New message title field** it gets reflected in the /archive page source.

**We know it's vulnerable to** [SSTI](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/ssti-server-side-template-injection) ,  but we donâ€™t know which template is being used here

 ### Identifying The Template

 Following the image , we get it's either Jinja2 or Twig. 

## Gaining Reverse Shell

I uploaded a bash script, prepared my listener, and executed the script

## Enumeration 

Launching Linpeas script, in ``Finding passwords inside logs`` we find : 
**POST /reset_password?email=Guitar123" 500 453 "http://doctor.htb/reset_password"**

Switching from web user to shaun, and we get user.txt

## Privilege Escalation

Going back to the open Port (HTTPS/Splunk (8089)), there is an interesting blog showing how to [abuse the splunk](https://eapolsniper.github.io/2020/08/14/Abusing-Splunk-Forwarders-For-RCE-And-Persistence/)

Following the Blog , and since we have user shaun his password Guitar123. I launched the script with the necessary parameters and started listener :

After executing the exploit, we get a connection

I had fun solving this machine, Shout out to the creator [egotisticalSW](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/94858). Hope you enjoyed the walkthrough.
Peace.
